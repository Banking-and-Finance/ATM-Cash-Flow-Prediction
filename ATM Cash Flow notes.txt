Both credit & debit card users are considered as ATM customers
There are four parties involved in cash logistics operations:
1. Central Bank (supervisor of the entire cash flow)
2. Cash-In-Transit (CIT) Company (store and transport cash as per requirement)
3. Commercial Banks (dispense cash to customers)
4. Customers (final recipients of cash)
Deposited cash is also circulated along this channel.

Existing system
A cash processing unit exists which is responsible for determining forecast amounts and cash monitoring of each ATM.
At the final stage, the bank informs cash amounts and provides money to CITs for refilling cash.

They conducted interviews with bank officials, managers and such to develop questionnaires and find out which factors affect bank withdrawals the most.

Their data was from 2016-2017, so they adjusted it for inflation using Consumer Price Index value (CPI)

Time Series analysis (whatever that is) is definitely the way to go.
Combining it with ANNs will increase accuracy even further.
Research was conducted on single ATM and if multiple ATMs are considered then some could be clustered together based on their location.
